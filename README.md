## Machine Learning Model Deployment: Sports Car Price Prediction

This project demonstrates the deployment of a machine learning model for predicting sports car prices, using Flask, Docker, and Kubernetes.

Project Components:

Machine Learning Model: model33.pkl (pre-trained model saved in Pickle format)
Flask Application: app.py (creates a RESTful API for model interaction)
Dockerfile: defines the Docker image build instructions
Kubernetes Manifests: deployment.yaml and service.yaml (deployment configuration files)
Additional Files:
requirements.txt (dependencies for the Python environment)
sports-car-price-prediction.ipynb (Jupyter notebook for model training and evaluation, optional)
index.html (optional frontend for user interaction)
style1.css (optional stylesheet for frontend)
Prerequisites:

Python (https://www.python.org/downloads/)
Docker (https://www.docker.com/)
Kubernetes (https://kubernetes.io/) with kubectl installed (https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl-linux/)
Getting Started:

Clone the repository:

Bash
git clone https://<your_repository_url>
Use code with caution.
Install dependencies:

Bash
cd <project_directory>
pip install -r requirements.txt
Use code with caution.
Build the Docker image:

Bash
docker build -t sports-car-price-predictor .
Use code with caution.
Deploy the application to Kubernetes:

(Ensure you have a running Kubernetes cluster and the necessary credentials)

Bash
kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml
kubectl apply -f service.yaml
Use code with caution.
Access the API:

The deployed Flask application exposes an API endpoint. Check the service.yaml file for the service port (e.g., 5000).

Bash
curl http://localhost:5000/predict
Use code with caution.
Note: This is a basic example. The specific API endpoint and request format depend on your Flask application implementation.

Additional Information:

Refer to the code within the project directory for detailed implementation details.
The Kubernetes manifests may require adjustments based on your cluster configuration.
Explore Flask, Docker, and Kubernetes documentation for a deeper understanding.
Optional Frontend:

If you have included index.html and style1.css, you can set up a frontend to interact with the API. This requires configuration beyond the scope of this README.
